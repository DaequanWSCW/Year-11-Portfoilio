<h3>Feedback</h3>
<h4>What do you think I can improve in?</h4>
<p>"I think you should make the carves more proportionate"</p>
<p>"Shape the head better"</p>
<h4>What do you think I did good </h4>
<p>"You did good at making the character big and tall" </p>
<p>"Creating this kind of character is a good idea"</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>I made the carves more proportionate due to the fact that it was too low <br>
  and that isn't where carves are meant to be </p>
  <p>I also shaped up the head better instead of making it seem blocky, I made it more realistic</p>
  <p>I also redrew the arm to give it a better anghle since it would be easier to model.</p>

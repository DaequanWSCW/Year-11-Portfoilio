<h1>Developement</h1>
<h2>YR 11 Portfolio</h2>
<h2>Task 1</h2>
<hr>
<p> I have drawn my turnaround character </p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I feel like my character's carves look a bit weird.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<h4>What do you think I can improve in?</h4>
<p>"I think you should make the carves more proportionate"</p>
<p>"Shape the head better"</p>
<h4>What do you think I did good </h4>
<p>"You did good at making the character big and tall" </p>
<p>"Creating this kind of character is a good idea"</p>
<hr>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>I made the carves more proportionate due to the fact that it was too low <br>
  and that isn't where carves are meant to be </p>
  <p>I also shaped up the head better instead of making it seem blocky, I made it more realistic</p>
  <p>I also redrew the arm to give it a better anghle since it would be easier to model.</p>

<h2>Task 2</h2>
<p>I have completed my torso and I am looking for feedback</p>
<br>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>The torso looks a little bit funny. I want to stick the chest out <br>
a little bit since it is quite flat.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>What things do I need to imrpove on?</p>
<p>"Top of torse looks too disproportionate and the side looks weird "</p>
<p>"Looks a bit funny and quite at the front flat"</p>
<p>What have I done well?</p>
<p>"You did well at shaping the back since it looks even and right"</p>
<p>"You did really well at shaping the start of the shoulders</p>

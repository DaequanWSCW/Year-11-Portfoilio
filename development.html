<h1>Development</h1>
<h2>YR 11 Portfolio</h2>
<h2>Turnaround</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p> I have decided to make my turnaround character fit in 9 lines in able for him<br>
to have a description of a "buff character"</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I feel like my character's carves look a bit weird.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<h4>What do you think I can improve in?</h4>
<p>"I think you should make the carves more proportionate"</p>
<p>"Shape the head better"</p>
<h4>What do you think I did good </h4>
<p>"You did good at making the character big and tall" </p>
<p>"Creating this kind of character is a good idea"</p>
<hr>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>I made the carves more proportionate due to the fact that it was too low <br>
  and that isn't where carves are meant to be </p>
  <p>I also shaped up the head better instead of making it seem blocky, I made it more realistic</p>
  <p>I also redrew the arm to give it a better anghle since it would be easier to model.</p>

<h2>Torso</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>I started off with a cube and mirrored it to begin my torso</p>
<p>I then added loop cuts to create more vertices and started shaping up the torso</p>
<br>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>The torso looks a little bit funny. I want to stick the chest out <br>
a little bit since it is quite flat.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>What things do I need to imrpove on?</p>
<p>"Top of torse looks too disproportionate and the side looks weird "</p>
<p>"Looks a bit funny and quite flat at the front"</p>
<p>What have I done well?</p>
<p>"You did well at shaping the back since it looks even and right"</p>
<p>"You did really well at shaping the start of the shoulders</p>
<hr>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>I have made my characters chest stick out more and made it curve <br>
back in to the stomach</p>
<p>I have also made the top of the back more flatter <br>
  so it doesn't look like a diamoand</p>
  <p>I also made it look less weirder and just made it more natural <br>
  which is why I made the chest sticdsk out a bit so it looks natural. <br>
I also makes my character fit the title better as "buff"</p>

<h2>Arms</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>I made the different cubes to create the upper part of<br>
   the arma and the lower part of the arm</p>
   <p>I then looped cut to create more vertices so it will be easier to shape the arm</p>
   <hr>
   <h3>Testing</h3>
   <p>I had a lot of trouble doing the arm and it looks really funny and weird.</p>
   <img src="arm before update.png" class="armbeforeupdate"

<hr>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>What things do I need to improve on?</p>
<p>"The arm looks disproportionate and the upper arm should be a litle bit<br>
   bigger than the lower arm"</p>
   <p>"The arm looks a bit funny and should be reshaped"</p>
<p>Would this suit for kids from 8-12 years old?</p>
<p>"No I don't think so due to the fact that it doesn't look proportionate"</p>
<p>"No it looks like the triceps just float there"</p>\
<hr>
<h2>Imrpovements</h2>
<p>I struggle a lot doing this so it doesn't look any different but <br>
I tried shaping the arm better but mainly worked on it from the back. </p>

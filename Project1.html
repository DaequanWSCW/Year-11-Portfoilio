  Kids this age would start to enjoy more action in their games and more skill based</h4>

<h3>Implication</h3>

<h5>Aesthetics</h5>

<h4>Aesthetics is all about making something look good. This is really important because <br>
one of the most important parts of a game is the looks of the character </h4>

<h5> I will address this by:</h5>

<h4> My character will be a big, buff, muscular dark skinned man who wears <br>
  tight clothes and will also have a nice, fresh buzz cut. He is a  <br>
  man who was born and raised in Samoa and his name is Sione.</h4>

  <h5>Functionality</h5>
  
  <h4>Functionality is making a working low-poly character that will do what it is coded to do<br>
  The most important part of the character would be rigging since wihtout that the character <br>
wouldn't even work/function</h4>
  <h5>I will address this by:</h5>

   <h4>This character would be able to do simple tasks such as sprinting, walking, jumping. <br>
    it could possibly do more complicated stuff like vaulting and mantling if possible.</h4>

    <h5>Usability</h5>
    <h4>Usability is making a low-poly character easy to use and have possilbe and not too complicated controls  </h4>
    <h5> I will address this by:</h5>
    <h4>I will make the characters movement smooth and have good, natural running styles other than wonky <br>
    uncoordinated running  style/animation style</h4>

    <h5>Intellectual Property</h5>
    <h4>Intellectual Property is the rights people have for the thing they created. Which means you cannot use <br>
    it without their permission </h4>
    <h5> I will address this by:</h5>
    <h4>My character will not be an ordinary looking person or have a common race for a character. <br>
    My character is a broad, muscular, tall man from Samoa which you don't usually get for video games</h4>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>Our project is on a Hangman game which you can pick themes which gives you a better idea on guessing words. <br>
The game would have up to 5 themes that is random which you cannot pick. </h4>

<section id="end-users2">
<h3>End Users</h3>
<h4>My end users are for kids who are aged at 5-12 years old. Kids don't know that many words which is one <br>
of the main reasons why we decided to do themes, which also gives them a good idea on the letters they guess.<br>
I think our group should consider a tutorial or a example just for the ones who have never played hangman. <br>
Probably think of making it an option. But putting down  the rules is a must for us.</h4>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h4>We require a introduction that introduces the player to the game and let them know what they are doing/playing<br>
<br>This would be so they wouldn't get stuck in the middle of the game and not know what to do. </h4>
<h3>Win/Loss checker</h3>
<h4>A win and loss checker is definately a requirement for our game in order to tell the user if they got it correct or not.<br> 
It will also tell them how many chances they have left and how many they have corrrect that would be showing them for the whole game.</h4>
</section>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<h4>We will tell the user it is the end of the game by having a "Game Over" text. We will have randomised texts if you lose and ones if you win.<br>
We will also add a replay question if the users wishes to replay the whole game without going through the introduction. </h4>

<h3>Implications</h3>
<br>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<h4>We wont make it confusing and will make the game nice and simple and easy so the players can understand and know what they are doing.<br>
We will do this by having a good introduction basically showing all the rules </h4>

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<h4>We will make sure there will be zero bugs in the game so there will be no issues for the players while they play the game.<br>
We will make sure of this by using our developement page on testing our codes if it will work or not. We will get other people to test our game<br>
to check if there are bugs they we couldn't find that they could.</h4>

<h3>Accessability</h3>
<h4>We will make this accessable by having to choose the theme and each theme would have a different difficulty and a easy start in order for the <br>
  players to know what difficulty their hangman would be.</h4>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>Our project is on a Hangman game which you can pick themes which gives you a better idea on guessing words. <br>
The game would have up to 5 themes that is random which you cannot pick. </h4>

<h3>End Users</h3>
<h4>My end users are for kids who are aged at 5-12 years old. Kids don't know that many words which is one <br>
of the main reasons why we decided to do themes, which also gives them a good idea on the letters they guess.<br>
I think our group should consider a tutorial or a example just for the ones who have never played hangman. <br>
Probably think of making it an option. But putting down  the rules is a must for us.</h4>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<h4>We require a introduction that introduces the player to the game and let them know what they are doing/playing<br>
<br>This would be so they wouldn't get stuck in the middle of the game and not know what to do. </h4>
<h4>We want a win loss checker</h4>
